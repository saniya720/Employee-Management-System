# Employee-Management-System

An Employee Management System built during my internship using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides features like adding, editing, and deleting employees, auto-generating unique IDs, salary-based highlighting, real-time total salary calculation, and a sortable employee table with dynamic DOM updates.
