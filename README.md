# Employee-Management-System

This project was developed during my internship to demonstrate API integration and dynamic data rendering using frontend technologies. The application fetches user and activity data from the JSONPlaceholder API
 and displays it in interactive tables.

Features

Fetches and displays user details (ID, Name, Email, City, Zipcode) dynamically.

Provides an Activities section with delayed API fetching to simulate real-world scenarios.

Displays activity details (User ID, Task ID, Title, Completion Status) in a structured table.

Success message confirmation after data is fetched.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using fetch() for asynchronous API calls.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

API Source: JSONPlaceholder (REST API)
